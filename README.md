**Overview:**
- I'm going to create a VM running on Server 2022 OS and this will be my domain controller(Server that will run Active Directory Services). In there I will create a forest, “mydomain.com”, and this will be the name of my domain.

- I will then create another VM called Client-1 which will run on Windows 11 OS and this will act as a workstation. My attempt will be to join Client-1 to the domain. My ultimate goal with this virtual machine is to be able to login successfully with the users we created in DC-1(Domain Controller). 

<br><br><br>

**Create the Domain Controller VM (Windows Server 2022) named “DC-1”**

What do we mean by Domain Controller? 

This will be the server that runs Active Directory Domain Services(AD DS) and handles all of the core functions.

Begin by:
- Creating a resource group
- Create virtual network, called Active-Directory Vnet
- Create the virtual machine
- Assign the appropriate Resource Group
- Put it in the same region as your virtual network
- Image: Windows Server 2022 Datacenter(Azure Edition) x64
- Administrator Account: Pick a username & password and save it for later
- Ensure it’s in the Active-Directory Vnet we created earlier
- Click Create to begin the creation process

<br><br><br><br>

**Important Step:** Set Domain Controller’s NIC Private IP address to be static

In this scenario, we will be joining the Client-1 virtual machine to the domain, they rely on that static IP address to locate the domain controller using DNS. 

So, why do we want to set the DC’s(Domain Controller) private IP to be static? 

Very simple, we don't want to lose connectivity in any given situation. So we set the private IP address to static. 

<br><br>
**Setting DC's private IP to static**

<img width="467" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8e96c08-5ffe-4a4a-95e1-a4531071ef91" />
<br><br><br>

Next, we must login to the virtual machine and disable the windows firewall. We're only doing this to ensure that Client-1 is able to talk to DC-1 through our internal IP’s.
Lets first launch our Windows Server 2022 virtual machine to ensure a successful installation. On my computer, I will do a remote connection to the server using RDP & the Server’s Public IP and enter the appropriate credentials. Once logged in, if you see the server manager immediately pop up, everything looks good. In the search bar, type run, and input this command, “wf.msc”, this will open the firewall settings. Turn off the firewall state for all profiles, such as Domain, Private, and Public.

**Disable all the firewall settings**

<br><br><br><br>


**Create the Client VM (Windows 10) named “Client-1**

Create the Windows 10 Virtual Machine 
-Assign to resource group Active Directory
-Name the VM Client-1
-Image: Windows 10 Pro
-2 vcpus(Virtual CPU’s) will be sufficient
-Create a username & password(be sure to document it for later)
-Ensure that it’s operating on the same Virtual Network we created earlier: Active Directory-VneT
-Click create virtual machine

**Important Step:** After the VM is created, set Client-1's DNS settings to DC-1's private IP address.

Our Client-1 virtual machine’s DNS server, which by default is the one offered from Azure, has no idea of our private network or the domain in which we are operating. So we need to configure the settings so it knows who to communicate with. 

To get started, on Azure, open Client-1's network settings, navigate to the DNS servers, and input the public IP of the DC-1 VM.

**Configuring DNS settings for Client-1:**

<img width="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb926d3-40f2-44c4-b28f-c96c4dd62b67" />

Once you’ve configured the DNS settings, restart the Client-1 virtual machine on azure, remotely connect again and attempt to ping DC-1’s private IP. Observe for a successful ping(we ping to ensure both machines are able to communicate).

We can even run the command “ipconfig /all” on powershell to observe that the DNS server’s private IP is set to the domain controller.

<h2>Deploying Active Directory</h2>

**Part 1**

**Install Active Directory**

Login to DC-1 and install Active Directory Domain Services:
- Open Server manager
- Navigate to Add Roles & Features under Manage in the top right hand corner
- Continue to Server Roles and check the box for Active Directory Domain Services
- Install



![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7c9cfe3-0875-48ef-875f-8b116e31f1bd)

**Promote as a Domain Controller:**
- Navigate to the notifications icon and hit “promote this server a domain controller”
- Click Add a new forest
- In root domain, input mydomain.com (can be anything you want)
- Install


**Create a domain admin user within the domain:**
- In Active Directory Users and Computers(AD UC), create an Organizational Unit(OU) called “_EMPLOYEES”
- Create a new OU(Organizational Unit) called “_ADMINS”
- Create a new employee named “Jane Doe” with the username of jane_admin and provide a password for that account. 
- Add Jane Doe to the “Domain Admins” Security Group
- Log out/close your remote connection and attempt to log back in with “mydomain.com\jane_admin”

<br><br>

**Join Client-1 to our domain(mydomain.com):**
- Open settings , go to the About and open the advanced settings
- Find Computer Name/Domain options 
- Under Domain input the domain address, mydomain.com
- It’s going to ask you for the username/password, input the details
- Login as the Domain Controller, Verify it shows up in the AD UC(Active Directory Users Computers).
- Create one last OU(Organizational Unit), “_CLIENTS”, and drag Client-1 into its location

<br><br><br><br>

**Part 2**
<br><br>

**Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1**

- Login to Client-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin
- Access System Properties
- Click Remote Desktop
- Allow “Domain Users” access to remote desktop


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9abbcb67-29c5-43d2-ad48-52c23216c072)



**Create a plethora of users and attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the users**

- Log in to DC-1 as jane_admin
- Utilize Powershell_ise as an administrator
- Create a new file and paste the contents of the script(https://github.com/PouyaDini10/configure-ad/blob/main/CreateADusernames) into it
- Run the script and we will observe the content being generated
- When finished, open ADUC(Active Directory Users & Computers) and observe the content in the appropriate OU(Organizational Unit) (_EMPLOYEES)
- Attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the accounts we generated

<br><br>

**Powershell_ise as an Administrator**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e101c903-73ee-4286-9bef-03e0f76d7463)

**Powershell_ise(Integrated Scripting Environment)** is basically a graphical editor with powershell integrated into one unit. What makes it unique is that you run,save,edit, and configure scripts for more versatility.

The PowerShell script creates up to 10,000 random Active Directory user accounts using randomly generated first and last names, assigning each user the same password (Password1). It uses a function to create realistic-looking names and then runs a loop to call New-AdUser to create each account in a specific OU called _EMPLOYEES.

<br><br>

Once you have all the code imputed, click run, and the Powershell_ise will begin creating our 1000 users.

You should immediately see this in your console:

<br><br>

Now I'm going to just double check in ADUC(Active directory Users & Computers) to ensure everything is synchronized properly.
